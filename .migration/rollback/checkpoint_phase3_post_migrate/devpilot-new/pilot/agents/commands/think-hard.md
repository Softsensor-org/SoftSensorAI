# Think Hard

Take time to deeply analyze the problem before proposing solutions. This command triggers extended reasoning mode.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Problem Decomposition
- What is the core problem?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the success criteria?
- What are potential edge cases?

### 2. Solution Space Exploration
- List 3-5 different approaches
- Compare trade-offs (performance, maintainability, complexity)
- Identify risks and mitigations
- Consider long-term implications

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- Break down into phases
- Identify dependencies
- Define test criteria
- Plan rollback approach

### 4. Decision Matrix
| Approach | Pros | Cons | Risk | Effort | Recommendation |
|----------|------|------|------|--------|----------------|
| Option 1 | ... | ... | Low/Med/High | S/M/L | Yes/No |
| Option 2 | ... | ... | Low/Med/High | S/M/L | Yes/No |
| Option 3 | ... | ... | Low/Med/High | S/M/L | Yes/No |

### 5. Recommended Path
After careful analysis, the recommended approach is:
- **Choice**: [Selected option]
- **Rationale**: [2-3 key reasons]
- **First Steps**: [Immediate actions]
- **Success Metrics**: [How to measure]

## Usage Examples
