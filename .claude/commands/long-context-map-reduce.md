# long-context-map-reduce

Process large codebases or documents using map-reduce pattern for comprehensive analysis.

## Instructions

For analyzing large amounts of content:

### Map Phase
1. **Divide content** into logical chunks (files, modules, sections)
2. **Process each chunk** independently
3. **Extract key information** from each piece
4. **Create summaries** with relevant details

### Reduce Phase
1. **Combine summaries** from map phase
2. **Identify patterns** across chunks
3. **Synthesize insights** into coherent analysis
4. **Generate final report** with findings

### Use Cases
- Full codebase analysis
- Multi-file refactoring plans
- Cross-module dependency analysis
- Large document summarization
- Pattern detection across files

### Output Format
```
MAP RESULTS:
- File/Section 1: [summary]
- File/Section 2: [summary]
...

PATTERNS FOUND:
- Pattern 1: [description]
- Pattern 2: [description]

FINAL ANALYSIS:
[Synthesized insights]

RECOMMENDATIONS:
[Action items based on analysis]
```

Especially useful for repositories with 100+ files or documents over 10k lines.
