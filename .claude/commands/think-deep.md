# think-deep

Use structured thinking to solve complex problems with extended reasoning.

## Instructions

When I need deep analysis or complex problem solving:

1. **Break down the problem** into clear components
2. **Use step-by-step reasoning** with explicit thinking sections
3. **Consider multiple approaches** before choosing one
4. **Validate assumptions** at each step
5. **Provide confidence levels** for conclusions

Format your response with:
- <thinking> tags for reasoning process
- <approach> tags for strategy discussion
- <solution> tags for final answer
- <confidence> tags for certainty level (low/medium/high)

Example areas needing deep thinking:
- Algorithm design and optimization
- System architecture decisions
- Debugging complex issues
- Security vulnerability analysis
- Performance bottleneck identification

Focus on correctness over speed. Take time to think through edge cases.
