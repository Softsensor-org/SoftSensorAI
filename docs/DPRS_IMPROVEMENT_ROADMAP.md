### 4. 🔒 Security: 100/100 ✅ (Maintain)

Already at maximum! Continue to:

- Run regular security audits
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities
- Maintain security documentation

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Testing Infrastructure

1. Set up pytest with coverage
2. Write initial test suite
3. Configure CI for coverage reporting
4. Target: 60% coverage

### Week 2: Test Coverage

1. Expand test suite
2. Add integration tests
3. Add E2E tests
4. Target: 80% coverage

### Week 3: Documentation & DX

1. Create API documentation
2. Set up pre-commit hooks
3. Add Docker dev environment
4. Enhance automation scripts

### Week 4: Polish & Scale

1. Achieve 90% test coverage
2. Performance optimization
3. Load testing
4. Production readiness review

## Quick Wins (Can do today)

1. **Run pytest to generate coverage** (+10-20 points)

   ```bash
   pip install -r config/requirements.txt
   pytest --cov
   ```

2. **Add pre-commit configuration** (+5 points)

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

3. **Create API documentation** (+5 points)
   - Document all public scripts
   - Add usage examples
   - Create reference guide

## Success Metrics

- **DPRS Score**: 90+ (SCALE phase)
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+
- **Test Count**: 50+ test files
- **Documentation**: Complete API docs
- **CI/CD**: All checks passing
- **Security**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities

## Monitoring Progress

Run DPRS regularly to track improvements:

```bash
bash scripts/dprs.sh --output artifacts --verbose
```

Current trajectory: **80 → 90+ in 2-4 weeks** with focused effort on testing.
