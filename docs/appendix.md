# Appendix: Specific Strengths Worth Keeping

- Guardrails clarity in `CLAUDE.md`: The loop (Plan→Code→Test), explicit safety rules, performance tips, and Git hygiene give developers consistent, reliable guidance and reduce variance between runs.
- Wizard hooks (commit sanitizer): The commit-message sanitizer prevents bot co-authorship and boilerplate noise, keeping history clean and human-authored.
- Makefile metrics: `stats` and `stats-json` enable simple trend tracking (scripts count, LOC, functions, TODOs) across time and PRs, providing lightweight, actionable telemetry.

These elements drive consistency, safety, and observability without adding friction. Preserve them as you evolve the system.
