Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are

any action they deem in violation:

### 3. Temporary Ban

behavior.
