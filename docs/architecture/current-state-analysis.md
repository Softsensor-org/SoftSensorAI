- **Issues**:
  - Mixed configuration formats (JSON, YAML, MD)
  - No central configuration management
  - Duplicate command definitions

#### 2.2.3 Profile System
- **Purpose**: Skill and project phase management
- **Structure**:
  - Skills: vibe → beginner → l1 → l2 → expert
  - Phases: poc → mvp → beta → scale
- **Issues**:
  - Non-intuitive naming (l1, l2)
  - No clear progression indicators
  - Separate permission files per skill

#### 2.2.4 Workflow Automation
- **Purpose**: Development workflow automation
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `scripts/apply_profile.sh` (profile application)
  - `scripts/doctor.sh` (health checks)
  - `scripts/generate_tickets.sh` (issue generation)
- **Issues**:
  - Inconsistent naming conventions
  - No unified workflow engine
  - Scripts scattered across directories
