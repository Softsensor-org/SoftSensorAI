# Documentation Review Report

**Date**: 2025-09-02 **Status**: ✅ Documentation aligned with repository structure

## Summary

All documentation has been reviewed and updated to ensure consistency with the actual repository
structure and user workflow.

## Key Understanding

### User Workflow

1. **SoftSensorAI is installed to `~/devpilot`** - Users clone the repo once to their home directory
2. **Scripts run FROM SoftSensorAI directory** - Commands like `~/devpilot/setup/repo_wizard.sh`
3. **Configuration applied TO other repos** - SoftSensorAI configures projects without moving them
4. **`dp` CLI is the main interface** - Located at `~/devpilot/bin/dp`

### Command Structure

The `dp` CLI provides these main commands:

- `dp init` - Initialize project with doctor → profile → build
- `dp project` - Create/show devpilot.project.yml
- `dp tickets` - Generate structured backlog (JSON → CSV)
- `dp review` - AI review of code changes
- `dp review --preview` - Review with preview logs
- `dp palette` - Interactive command browser (requires fzf)

### Installation Paths

All installation scripts are in `~/devpilot/install/`:

- `key_software_linux.sh` - Linux/WSL tools
- `key_software_macos.sh` - macOS tools
- `productivity_extras.sh` - Optional extras
- `ai_clis.sh` - AI CLI tools
- `codex_cli.sh` - Codex setup

## Documentation Files Reviewed

### Core Documentation ✅

- **README.md** - Main documentation, properly references private repo status
- **docs/quickstart.md** - Comprehensive quickstart guide with correct paths
- **docs/existing_repo_setup.md** - Detailed guide for existing repos

### Tutorials ✅

- **tutorials/day-in-the-life.md** - Real-world scenarios
- **tutorials/quick-start-this-week.md** - 5-day onboarding plan

### Installation & Setup ✅

- **docs/after-clone-playbook.md** - Updated to note private repo requirements
- **scripts/doctor.sh** - Fixed to show correct installation paths

## Key Updates Made

1. **Fixed doctor.sh paths** - Now uses `$PROJECT_ROOT/install/` paths
2. **Updated after-clone-playbook.md** - Added note about private repo
3. **Verified all setup scripts exist** - All referenced scripts confirmed

## Command Palette System

The command palette (`dp palette`) works with:

- **Justfile** - Build commands (if present in user's project)
- **Command Registry** - Generated from available commands
- **fzf** - Interactive fuzzy finder for command selection
- **AI Shim** - Abstracts AI provider selection

## Private Repository Considerations

Since the repository is private:

- ❌ `curl` commands won't work without authentication
- ✅ Users must clone via SSH: `git@github.com:Softsensor-org/SoftSensorAI.git`
- ✅ Documentation correctly notes this limitation

## Documentation Health

### Strengths

- Clear separation between SoftSensorAI directory and user projects
- Comprehensive command documentation
- Good examples and scenarios
- Proper skill level progression

### Verified Working

- Installation process via `setup_all.sh`
- Profile management system
- Persona management
- Documentation check system
- OS compatibility across platforms

## Recommendations

1. **For Public Release**: Update curl commands when repo becomes public
2. **For Users**: Always clone to `~/devpilot` for consistency
3. **For Documentation**: Keep paths absolute to avoid confusion

## Conclusion

The documentation accurately reflects the repository structure and intended user workflow. The
system is designed to be installed once in `~/devpilot` and then used to configure multiple projects
without reorganizing the user's directory structure.
