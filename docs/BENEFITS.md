# Time savings (conservative estimates)
repo_setup_hours_saved = 1.25 * 12  # monthly
pr_review_hours_saved = 16 * 50     # weekly
backlog_hours_saved = 2.75 * 12     # monthly
security_hours_saved = 15 * 4       # quarterly
onboarding_hours_saved = 80 * 3     # per hire

total_hours_saved = (
    repo_setup_hours_saved +
    pr_review_hours_saved +
    backlog_hours_saved +
    security_hours_saved +
    onboarding_hours_saved
) * team_size / 10  # Scale by team

hourly_rate = avg_salary / hours_per_year
annual_savings = total_hours_saved * hourly_rate

print(f"Annual time saved: {total_hours_saved:,.0f} hours")
print(f"Annual cost savings: ${annual_savings:,.0f}")
print(f"ROI: {annual_savings / 1000:.0%}")  # Assuming $1000 setup cost

# Output:
