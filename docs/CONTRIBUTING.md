# Contributing to SoftSensorAI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SoftSensorAI! This guide will help you get started.

## üìñ Documentation First

Before contributing, please review our comprehensive documentation:

- **[Architecture Overview](docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)** - Understanding SoftSensorAI's design
- **[Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart.md)** - Getting SoftSensorAI running
- **[Week with SoftSensorAI](docs/WEEK_WITH_DEVPILOT.md)** - Daily workflow examples

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SoftSensorAI.git
   cd SoftSensorAI
   ```

2. **Set up SoftSensorAI on itself** (dogfooding!)

   ```bash
   # Install SoftSensorAI globally
   ./setup_all.sh

   # Setup this repo with SoftSensorAI
   ./setup/existing_repo_setup.sh --skill expert --phase beta

   # Add development personas
   ./scripts/persona_manager.sh add software-architect
   ./scripts/persona_manager.sh add devops-engineer
   ```

3. **Run the validation suite**
   ```bash
   ./validation/validate_agents.sh
   scripts/run_checks.sh --all
   ```

### Current Priorities

Check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Softsensor-org/SoftSensorAI/issues) for:

- Issues labeled `good first issue` for newcomers
- Issues labeled `help wanted` for experienced contributors
- Issues labeled `enhancement` for new features

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- **Follow existing patterns**: Study similar files before making changes
- **Maintain compatibility**: Ensure changes work across Linux/macOS/WSL
- **Update documentation**: Add/update docs for user-facing changes
- **Add tests**: Include validation for new functionality

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run validation suite
./validation/validate_agents.sh

# Test setup scripts (use a clean environment)
./scripts/repo_plan.sh /tmp/test work backend test-project https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git

# Test specific components
shellcheck setup/*.sh scripts/*.sh
```

### 4. Use SoftSensorAI for Development

```bash
# Generate implementation plan
claude --system-prompt system/active.md "/explore-plan-code-test implement [your feature]"

# Security review before commit
claude --system-prompt .claude/commands/security-review.md "review my changes"

# Generate tests
claude --system-prompt .claude/commands/patterns/test-first.md "create tests for [feature]"
```

### 5. Submit Pull Request

- Write clear commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Reference relevant issues
- Include testing instructions
- Update documentation as needed

## üîß Code Standards

### Shell Scripts

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- Enable strict mode: `set -euo pipefail`
- Use BSD-compatible commands (e.g., `sed -i''` not `sed -i`)
- Follow existing error handling patterns

### Documentation

- Use clear, actionable headings
- Include working code examples
- Provide both interactive and command-line usage
- Link between related documentation

### Python Scripts

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include type hints where helpful
- Write docstrings for functions
- Handle errors gracefully

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Works on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
- [ ] Works on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- [ ] Works in WSL2
- [ ] Handles missing dependencies gracefully
- [ ] Provides helpful error messages
- [ ] Follows existing UX patterns

### Automated Testing

- Add validation scripts to `validation/`
- Include example usage in documentation
- Test error conditions and edge cases

## üìã Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add support for Grok CLI integration
fix: handle missing .git directory gracefully
docs: update persona selection tutorial

## üè∑Ô∏è Pull Request Labels

We use these labels to categorize PRs:

- `enhancement`: New features
- `bug`: Bug fixes
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Seeking contributors
- `breaking change`: Breaking changes

## üîç Code Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: CI must pass (shellcheck, tests, etc.)
2. **Functionality Review**: Does it work as intended?
3. **Code Quality**: Is it maintainable and follows patterns?
4. **Documentation**: Are docs updated appropriately?
5. **Testing**: Is it adequately tested?

## üö´ What Not to Contribute

- Changes that break backward compatibility without discussion
- Platform-specific code without cross-platform considerations
- Large refactoring without prior issue discussion
- API keys or sensitive credentials (even in examples)
- Duplicate functionality that already exists
