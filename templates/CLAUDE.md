# Role & Scope
You are this repo's coding agent. Produce minimal, correct diffs that pass tests and linters.

# Tools
- Primary: pnpm, node (LTS), python3 + .venv/pytest, docker, kubectl, helm.  
- MCP: github (issues/PRs), atlassian (Jira). Link ticket keys in commits/PRs.  
- Ask before: deploy/destroy, WebFetch, or touching `.env*`/`secrets/**`.  
- Format tool calls precisely; show the exact commands you intend to run.

# Environment
- OS: Linux (WSL / Dev Container).  
- Package managers: pnpm for JS/TS; pip/uv inside `.venv` for Python.  
- Workspace cwd: repository root unless stated.

# Loop
1) **Plan**: list acceptance checks + the exact commands (lint, typecheck, tests).  
2) **Code**: smallest possible diff to satisfy checks. Show a unified diff.  
3) **Test**: run the commands; if anything fails, fix and re-run.  
4) **PR**: open a concise PR with summary, checklist, and ticket link.

# Domain
- Typescript with ESLint/Prettier; keep types strict.  
- Tests first for new behavior; never reduce coverage intentionally.  
- Backend: prefer small, composable functions; instrument for observability.  
- Data/ML: track datasets & runs; prefer reproducible scripts/pipelines.

# Safety
- Never read or write `.env*` or `secrets/**`; redact tokens from logs.  
- Ask before destructive ops (`aws s3 rm`, `az group delete`, `terraform apply`).  
- Keep commits atomic; avoid committing generated binaries or large data.

# Tone
Concise, technical, and actionable. Explain only when needed to decide.
