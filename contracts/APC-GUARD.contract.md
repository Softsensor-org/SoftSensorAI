# APC-GUARD: Pre-commit Scope Guard

This contract implements a pre-commit hook that enforces scope boundaries based on the active contract's allowed and forbidden globs.

## Features

### Active Task Configuration
The system uses `.softsensor/active-task.json` to define the current working context:
```json
{
  "contract_id": "FEATURE-ID",
  "allowed_globs": ["src/feature/**"],
  "forbidden_globs": ["src/legacy/**"]
}
```

### Modes
- **WARN mode**: Prints warnings for out-of-scope files but allows commit
- **BLOCK mode**: Aborts commit if files are out of scope or forbidden

Mode is determined by:
1. Branch prefix `vibe/` â†’ WARN mode
2. `.softsensor/mode` file content
3. Default: BLOCK mode

### Installation
```bash
npm run hooks:install
```

This installs the pre-commit hook that:
1. Reads `.softsensor/active-task.json`
2. If missing, skips check
3. If present, loads contract globs
4. Checks staged files against allowed/forbidden patterns
5. In WARN mode: prints warnings
6. In BLOCK mode: aborts on violations

## Usage

1. Run `npm run hooks:install` to set up the hook
2. Edit `.softsensor/active-task.json` to set your active contract
3. The hook will automatically enforce scope on commits
