# Day in the Life with SoftSensorAI

## Before SoftSensorAI (The Old Way)

```
Morning: New feature request arrives
├── Clone repo (5 min)
├── Set up lint/CI/husky manually (30-45 min)

├── Hand-rolled review prompt (15 min)
└── Inconsistent outputs, redo (30 min)

Total: 3-4 hours before writing any code
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Onboarding a New Developer

**Traditional Approach:**
1. Send them wiki links (they won't read)
2. Pair program for 2 days
3. Answer same questions repeatedly
4. Review their PRs heavily for 2 weeks
5. Still inconsistent after a month

**SoftSensorAI Approach:**
```bash
# Day 1 - New dev runs:
~/softsensorai/setup/existing_repo_setup.sh --skill beginner --phase mvp

# They immediately get:
- Appropriate commands for their level
- CI gates that teach best practices
- AI assistance calibrated to explain more
- Clear graduation criteria to level up

# Result: Shipping quality code by day 3
```

### Scenario 2: Emergency Security Audit

**Traditional Approach:**
1. Security team sends scary email
2. Scramble to run various scanners
3. Manually triage 500+ findings
4. Write report over 2 days
5. Half the findings are false positives

**SoftSensorAI Approach:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive security review
claude --system-prompt .claude/commands/security-review.md \
  "comprehensive security audit with OWASP Top 10"

# 10 minutes later, you have:
- Prioritized findings (P0/P1/P2)
- Remediation steps for each
- Estimated effort
- Export to CSV for tracking

# Result: Full audit in 15 minutes, not 2 days
```

### Scenario 3: Large PR Review

**Traditional Approach:**
1. 800-line PR sits for 3 days
2. Reviewer finally looks, overwhelmed
3. Gives superficial "LGTM"
4. Bugs slip through to production

**SoftSensorAI Approach:**
```bash
# AI reviewer runs automatically in CI
# Provides in 1-2 minutes:
- Security concerns flagged
- Performance implications noted
- Test coverage gaps identified
- Architectural concerns raised

# Human reviewer focuses on:
- Business logic correctness
- Team conventions
- Complex architectural decisions

# Result: Thorough review in 30 min, not 3 days
```

### Scenario 4: Creating a Backlog from Legacy Code

**Traditional Approach:**
1. PM and tech lead meet for 3 hours
2. Manually browse code, taking notes
3. Create tickets one by one in Jira
4. Argue about priorities
5. Still missing half the tech debt

**SoftSensorAI Approach:**
```bash
# Generate comprehensive backlog
claude --system-prompt .claude/commands/tickets-from-code.md \
  "analyze entire codebase"

# Outputs strict JSON → CSV with:
- ID, Title, Priority (P0-P3)
- Effort (XS/S/M/L/XL)
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies
- Security/performance flags

# Import to Jira in one shot
# Result: Full backlog in 15 minutes
```

## Progressive Skill Journey

### Week 1: Beginner
```bash
# Start with training wheels on
apply_profile.sh --skill beginner --phase mvp

# Available commands:
- /explore-plan-code-test (structured workflow)
- /fix-ci-failures (with explanations)
- Basic git operations

# CI catches common mistakes
# AI explains everything
```

### Week 4: Level 1
```bash
# Graduate to more responsibility
apply_profile.sh --skill l1 --phase mvp

# New powers unlocked:
- /secure-fix (find and fix security issues)
- /perf-scan (basic performance analysis)
- Can modify CI configuration

# Less hand-holding, more autonomy
```

### Month 3: Level 2
```bash
# Taking on complex work
apply_profile.sh --skill l2 --phase beta

# Advanced capabilities:
- /migration-plan (database migrations)
- /observability-pass (add monitoring)
- /k8s-dry-run (preview deployments)

# Now mentoring beginners
```

### Month 6: Expert
```bash
# Shaping team practices
apply_profile.sh --skill expert --phase scale

# Architect-level tools:
- /architect-spike (evaluate approaches)
- /think-hard (deep problem analysis)
- Define new commands for team

# Setting standards, not following them
```

## Quick Wins to Start Today

### 1. Morning Standup Prep (5 min)
```bash
# What did I do yesterday?
git log --oneline --author="$(git config user.name)" --since="24 hours ago"

# What am I doing today?
claude --system-prompt .claude/commands/tickets-from-diff.md \
  "analyze my working tree changes"
```

### 2. Pre-Push Review (2 min)
```bash
# Before pushing, always:
just review-local

# Gets you:
- Linting results
- Test coverage
- Security scan
- AI review of changes
```

### 3. Weekly Tech Debt Check (10 min)
```bash
# Every Friday, run:
claude --system-prompt .claude/commands/tickets-from-code.md \
  "identify top 5 tech debt items in src/"

# Add P2/P3 items to backlog
# Keeps debt from accumulating
```

### 4. New Feature Planning (15 min)
```bash
# When starting new feature:
claude --system-prompt .claude/commands/architect-spike.md \
  "design approach for [feature description]"

# Get structured plan with:
- Options and trade-offs
- Implementation steps
- Risk assessment
- Rollback plan
```

## Adoption Timeline

- Enable AI PR reviewer

### Week 2: Expand
- Add profiles to 3 more projects
- Train team on core commands
- Start tracking time saved
- Customize first command

### Week 3: Standardize
- All new projects use repo_wizard
- Define team phase progression
- Document graduation criteria
- Measure quality metrics

### Week 4: Scale
- Roll out to entire org
- Create custom personas
- Build team-specific commands
- Report ROI to leadership

## Metrics to Track

```yaml
velocity:
  before: 3-5 story points/dev/sprint
  after: 5-8 story points/dev/sprint

pr_review_time:
  before: 2-3 days average
  after: 2-4 hours average

onboarding_to_productive:
  before: 2-3 weeks
  after: 3-5 days

security_issues_caught:
  before: 20% pre-production
  after: 80% pre-production

time_to_setup_repo:
  before: 60-90 minutes
  after: 10-15 minutes
```

## Getting Help

```bash
# When stuck, these commands help:

# See what commands are available
ls .claude/commands/

# Check current profile settings
scripts/profile_show.sh

# Run health check
scripts/doctor.sh

# Get command help
claude --help

# Check if tools are installed
which rg fd jq pnpm
```

## Next Steps

1. **Today**: Run `setup_all.sh` and set up one project
2. **Tomorrow**: Try `/tickets-from-code` on your worst legacy code
3. **This Week**: Enable AI PR reviewer in CI
4. **Next Sprint**: Track velocity improvement
5. **Next Month**: Present ROI to leadership

Remember: SoftSensorAI isn't about replacing developers - it's about amplifying them. A junior with SoftSensorAI ships senior-quality code. A senior with SoftSensorAI becomes a force multiplier for the entire team.
